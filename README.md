## How to Use

Getting started with this template is incredibly simple. Follow these steps to make it your own.

### Step 1: Get the Files

You can either:
-   **Fork this repository** to your own GitHub account.
-   **Use it as a template** by clicking the `Use this template` button on GitHub.
-   **Download the ZIP** or clone the repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Kartik-Sohal/sleek-portfolio-template
    ```

### Step 2: Customize the Content (`index.html`)

Open the `index.html` file in a text editor. All the sections you need to edit are marked with comments like this:

`<!-- CHANGE THIS: ... -->`

Hereâ€™s a checklist of what to change:
-   **Page Title:** In the `<head>`, change the `<title>` to your name.
-   **Navigation & Hero:** Update your name and professional tagline in the `<header>` and hero section.
-   **About Me:** Write your personal introduction and add a URL to your profile picture. A square image (e.g., 500x500 pixels) works best.
-   **Projects:** This is the most important section!
    -   Fill in the details for the three example project cards.
    -   To **add a new project**, simply copy and paste the entire `<div class="project-card">...</div>` block.
    -   Remember to update the project titles, descriptions, technology tags, and links (to the live demo and source code).
-   **Contact Information:** Add your email address in the `mailto:` link and update the social media links (LinkedIn, GitHub, etc.).
-   **Footer:** Change "Your Name" in the copyright notice. The watermark credit should remain as is.

### Step 3: Customize the Style (Optional)

If you want to change the main color of the portfolio:

1.  Open the `style.css` file.
2.  At the very top, in the `:root` section, change the hex code for `--primary-color`.

    ```css
    :root {
        /* CHANGE THIS: This is the main accent color for buttons, links, and highlights. */
        --primary-color: #00bfa5; /* Change this to your favorite color! */
    }
    ```
